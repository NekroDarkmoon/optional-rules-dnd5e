# Optional Rules for D&D5e

This module aims to automate all the optional rules available in the official books and a few of the more popular hombrew ones.

## Supported Rules
Below is a list of the current optional rules that the module automates.
- Critical Hit and Fumble Rules.
- Proficiency Die Rules. 

## Dependencies
Some of the optional rules depend on other modules. While it is not required to install all the dependencies, it's recommended to do so. Nonetheless, if you're only using certain rules, you can just install the dependecies for the particular rule.

- LibWrapper
- Critical Hit and Fumble --> MidiQol.
